# Movie Trailer Website

This website is the result of project 1 of Udacity's full stack web developer
nanodegree. The aim of this project is to write some Python code which generates
the HTML for a webpage showing a gallery of favourite movies.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install Python if necessary (the code has been tested on Python 2.7).
3. Run fresh_tomatoes.py.

## Additional Infos

The gallery is based thumbnail images and text files for the movie descriptions.
These additional files are expected to be in the corresponding img and data
folders.

The website uses a responsive design based on Bootstrap in order to guarantee a
user-friendly and device-independent browsing experience.
